	\brief Represents semaphore utility.
	
	A semaphore object is a synchronization object that maintains a value between zero and 
a specified maximum value. The value is decremented each time a thread locks a semaphore object 
and incremented each time a thread releases the semaphore. 
	When the value reaches zero, no more threads can successfully lock the semaphore object state 
to become signaled. The state of a semaphore is set to signaled when its value is greater than zero, 
and nonsignaled when its value is zero.
	The semaphore object is useful in controlling a shared resource that can support a limited number of users. 
It acts as a gate that limits the number of threads sharing the resource to a specified maximum number.
<br><br>
	MySemaphore supplies functions wrapping semaphore object in linux and windows. NewSemaphore()
creates a semaphore object, and DeleteSemaphore() destroies it. 
	A thread uses the NewSemaphore() function to create a semaphore object. The creating thread specifies 
the initial value. The initial value must be neither less than zero nor greater than SYT_SEMAPHORE_MAXCOUNT.
	A thread can decrement a semaphore's value more than once by repeatedly specifying the same semaphore 
object in calls to LockSemaphore(). And then, you can use UnlockSemaphore() to increment the value.
